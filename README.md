# Custom 3rd Zigock Bot II for Linux Quake II

This is a custom port of the 3rd Zigock Bot II to Linux Quake II clients or servers. \
All warnings (up to gcc8) and unused variables have been addressed from the original source. \
The code has backport fixes, enhancements and features applied from various sources: tsmod, \
yquake2 and custom.

This was modified for my own use and driven by nostalgia for the Quake II servers of old. \
It was also fun, and sometimes exasperating, to dive into the codebase of such a classic game. \
There are many heavily modified versions of Quake II games, this mod keeps the look and feel of \
the original game, but allows the Quake II multiplayer experience sadly lacking in the present day. 

Tip of the hat to `Ponpoko`, original mod author and bot creator.

On global linux installs, **e.g.** `/usr/share/games`, you may need to specify `basepath` - See details below.

Bot chaining routes are supplied, further routes can be (re)created via the mod command `chedit` (See `CONFIG.txt`)

### ZigMode ZigFlag (Capture and Hold)

As the original `zigmode` appeared to be buggy and even half implemented, I have made this fun feature \
a little more enhanced, while keeping the original look and feel of the game. Minimal HUD enhancements, \
a timed flag return feature, bot distant spawning and added sound notifications to subtly alter the game \
dynamics and improve stability over the original game element.

`ZigMode` requires the included `.pak` file and a route chaining file for the map, many popular maps are \
included, further `.chn` can be created via the mod `chedit` function.

`Capture and Hold` plays best on smaller level maps with a couple of bots throw in.

Example config file for ZigFlag:

```
set zigmode 1
set zigspawn 1
set ctf 0
set aimfix 1
set spawnbotfar 1
set botlist default
set autospawn 3
set vwep 1
set maxclients 16
set basepath "/usr/share/games/quake2"
set dmflags 16384
set fraglimit 30
set timelimit 10
set maplist q2dmx
map q2dm1
```

See `CONFIG.txt` for further details.

## Installation

* Copy the *3zb2/* dir to your Quake II directory.
* Build the `game.so` by calling `make` and copy it to the *3zb2/* dir.

```
sudo cp -R 3zb2 /usr/share/games/quake2/3zb2

make

sudo cp release/game.so /usr/share/games/quake2/3zb2
```

## Running bots

To start `$` bots automatically, append:

    +set autospawn $

### Spawn bots at the furthest point

    spawnbotfar $

### Deathmatch

    /usr/lib/yamagi-quake2/quake2 -datadir /usr/share/games/quake2/ +set game 3zb2 +set deathmatch 1 +set autospawn 5 +exec game.cfg

### CTF (Capture the Flag)

Copy **CTF** `.pak` files to *3zb2/*

    sudo cp /usr/share/games/quake2/ctf/*.pak /usr/share/games/quake2/3zb2

**Single process**:

    /usr/lib/yamagi-quake2/quake2 -datadir /usr/share/games/quake2/ +set vid_gamma 1.400000 +set game 3zb2 +set deathmatch 1 +exec ctf.cfg 

**Separate server and client**:

    /usr/lib/yamagi-quake2/q2ded -datadir /usr/share/games/quake2/ +set game 3zb2 +set ip 127.0.0.1 +set port 27910 +set autospawn 5 +exec ctfserver.cfg

    /usr/lib/yamagi-quake2/quake2 -datadir /usr/share/games/quake2/ +set vid_gamma 1.400000 +game 3zb2 +exec ctfplayer.cfg +connect 127.0.0.1:27910

**Default grapple:** `bind MWHEELDOWN +hook`

## Bot commands (See full details in CONFIG.txt)

By default use: `KP_PLUS`, `KP_MINUS` & `KP_ENTER` for bot control

`Console`

Spawn `$` bots via:

    sv spb $

Remove `$` bots via:

    sv rmb $

## Other features (See full details in CONFIG.txt)

Improved aim, enable `1` (default) or disable `0` via:

    aimfix $

`Capture and Hold (ZigFlag)` mode for Deathmatch/Team games:

    zigmode $
    zigspawn $

## Errata

Specify a `basedir` to inform the mod of the system `baseq2` directory location. \
On system level installs this may be needed to ensure the mod can find`3zbconfig.cfg,` \
`3zbmaps.lst` and `chaining` files. The basedir can be specified in config via:

    set basepath "/usr/share/games/quake2"

Use on the following errors:

    3ZB CFG: file not found: ./3zb2/3zbconfig.cfg
    Chaining: file 3zb2/chdtm/q2dm1.chn not found.
